# PE-Rebrander

PE-Rebrander is a tool for rebranding Portable Executable (PE) files such
as `.exe` or `.dll` files.
This software is based on the native code from OpenJDK's JPackage.
It has been copied from [openjdk/jdk](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk) at
[5795c760db5](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/commit/5795c760db5bbfd7ff3b56a0c6236827526df70a)
and has been adapted for this single purpose.
